# poker_via_llm
This is a poker implementation with assistance of an LLM. It is not a complete implementation, but it is good enough to start playing via console. There might be some small edits on the code, but most of the code is obtained via generative AI: 

The promot sequence is more or less as it follows: 

- I want to write code in Python for a poker game, texas holdem. I would like the game to be played completely on console. I would like player cards to be shown, the floor cards and the pots. Can you help me with such code?  

- I would like only the hand of the current player to be visible. For the others, we can show the back of the cards

- I would like for the game to take into account for actions such as fold and check


The game interaction looks like this:
